# Shiny-App

This code is my attempt at an updated shiny app for Exploratory Cloud Based Data Analysis. This is a combination of the weather and accident data. 
It allows to user to filter the data by state, route type, and weather condition to figure out how many accidents happened under the given
criteria.
